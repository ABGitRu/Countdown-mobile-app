# Countdown mobile app

Users enter a name, emoji and photo for their countdown timer (e.g. “My Wedding”) and enter a date and time for when the event will take place. Afterwards, users can view the countdown screen for an event, showing how many years and days are left. The user can also add reminders about how much time is left until the event or how much has passed since the event. The idea was taken from [here](https://www.codementor.io/projects/mobile/countdown-mobile-app-bjzn08zcon).
